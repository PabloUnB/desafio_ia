## Part 1: MNIST Image Generation
- Trainned DCGAN model and compared results between each iteraction
- Generates synthetic MNIST digits
- Implements FID metrics
- CLI interface for generation

## Part 2: Audio Regeneration with MUSDB
- Preprocessed audios
- Trainned VAE model and compared results for each iteraction
- Regenerates audio stems
- Uses Mel spectrograms 
- Metrics: SDR, SNR, MSE

## How to run:
1. git clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebooks in order
    - jupyter notebook 01_img_generation.ipynb
    - jupyter notebook 02_audio_regeneration.ipynb
4. Datasets are downloaded automatically


### Option 1: Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PabloUnB/desafio_ia)

### Option 2: Local Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PabloUnB/desafio_ia.git
cd desafio_ia

# 1. Criate virtual environment (.venv)
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv .venv

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the notebooks
jupyter notebook 01_img_generation.ipynb
jupyter notebook 02_audio_regeneration.ipynb

## Results:
- MNIST images with FID < 50 after training
- Audio with SDR > 10 dB after reconstruction

```

## Implemented Models
Part 1: Image Generation
- Model: DCGAN
- Architecture: Generator + Discriminator
- Evaluation Metrics:
    * FID Score: Measures similarity between distributions (lower is better)
    * Inception Score: Diversity and quality (higher is better)
    * Visual Analysis: Qualitative comparison of samples
- Advantages: Fast inference
- Disadvantages: Instability during training

Part 2: Audio Regeneration
- Model: VAE
- Architecture: Encoder + Decoder 
- Evaluation Metrics:
    * SDR (Signal-to-Distortion Ratio): Reconstruction quality (dB)
    * SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio): Signal-to-noise ratio (dB)
    * MSE (Mean Squared Error): Mean squared error
    * Perceptual Score: Perceptual similarity
- Application: Faithful reconstruction
- Metrics: SDR-> 15-20 dB


## Expected Results
#### DCGAN for MNIST:
- FID: < 50 after 50 epochs
- Generation of recognizable digits
- Inference time: ~0.01s per image

#### VAE for Audio:
- SDR: 15-20 dB
- Faithful spectrogram reconstruction
- Interpolable latent space
